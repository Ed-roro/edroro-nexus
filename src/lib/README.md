# Lib Directory

This directory contains utility functions, hooks, and other helper code that can be reused across the application.

## Structure

- `/hooks`: Custom React hooks
- `/utils`: Utility functions
- `/api`: API client and related functions
- `/constants`: Application constants and configuration values
- `/context`: React context providers

## Best Practices

1. Keep functions small and focused on a single responsibility
2. Write unit tests for utility functions
3. Document complex functions with JSDoc comments
4. Export named functions rather than default exports when possible
5. Group related functionality in subdirectories
